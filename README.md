## Hi Community
My name is Max and I am an iOS developer.

I am interested in Swift, Objective-C and iOS. And to be aware of every innovation in rapidly changing world of programming, you have to watch every blog about iOS. But what if don't know what you should start from? I've prepared for you a list of necessary rss feeds.

## Getting started
1. Download any RSS client. I recommend to use Feedly or Reeder.

	* Feedly - https://feedly.com
	* Reeder - http://reederapp.com

2. Get my [OPML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgnlax/Feeds-for-iOS-Developer/master/subscriptions.opml) and import it!
